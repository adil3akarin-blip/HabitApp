# Quick start checklist (for you)

1) Create Expo project:
- `npx create-expo-app HabitGrid --template`
- move these prompts into your repo (or just paste into Windsurf)

2) Run TASK prompts in order:
- `00_OVERVIEW.md` (read once)
- `01_TASK_1_scaffold.md` (paste to Claude)
- then `02_TASK_2_...` etc.

3) If Claude breaks constraints:
Tell it:
- “Implement ONLY TASK N.”
- “Use smallest diff fix.”
- “Follow required output format.”
